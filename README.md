# Nifty-50-Closing-Price-Prediction
Objective : To perform time series analysis on the NIFTY stock price and forecasting using univariate ARIMA and ARIMAX modeling technique. I have further simplified the problem to predict the direction of Close price movements in the next N days (throughout our experiments N can take values 1, 5, and 30). Initially, I will take N=1, that means I want to predict the NIFTY 50 Close price movement in the next day. This is represented as a classification task where there are two possible outcomes (either the index went up in the next day or it went down).
